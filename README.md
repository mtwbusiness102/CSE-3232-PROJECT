# Buckeye Living – Student Housing Redevelopment App

## Overview
This project, **Buckeye Living**, was developed as part of the OSU CSE 3232 Software Requirements Analysis course. Our team, **Agile Buckeyes**, set out to address the growing challenges of student housing at The Ohio State University. With enrollment rising over 16% in the 2024–2025 academic year, demand for comfortable, safe, and well-maintained student housing has reached record highs. Many residence halls are decades old, and complaints about overcrowding, maintenance delays, and poor housing allocation are common.  

**Buckeye Living** is a proposed software solution: a mobile application that enables students to manage their housing assignments and submit maintenance requests more efficiently, while also providing housing staff with tools to streamline service responses and inspections. The app supports both iOS and Android platforms and is designed to improve the housing experience for students, staff, and parents.

## Vision and Mission
- **Vision:** To create a college living experience where students no longer need to worry about basic housing necessities or maintenance.
- **Mission:** To provide safe, modern, and practical housing solutions for Ohio State’s growing student population by improving communication, maintenance, and housing allocation efficiency.

## Planning with the SRS Workbook
Our team followed the **Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Workbook** provided in the course to guide each stage of our analysis and design process. The workbook allowed us to break down requirements systematically, trace goals to user needs, and refine our solution through multiple iterations.

### Steps We Took
1. **Domain Analysis**  
   We researched Ohio State’s housing environment, noting the diversity of housing options, rising enrollment numbers, and infrastructure concerns. Key issues included overcrowding, maintenance delays, and outdated facilities:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

2. **Problem & Solution Analysis**  
   - **Problems Identified:** Limited housing capacity, inefficient roommate matching, outdated maintenance systems, and low parent transparency.  
   - **Proposed Solution:** A housing management app offering real-time housing selection, roommate matching, in-app maintenance requests, sanitation alerts, and parent updates.

3. **Scope Definition**  
   - **In Scope:** Housing selection, waitlists, roommate matching, maintenance request submission, sanitation alerts, parent communication, and inspection tracking.  
   - **Out of Scope:** Construction of new dorms and affordability/financial aid initiatives:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

4. **Personas & User Stories**  
   We developed personas for **OSU Students**, **Housing Staff**, and **Parents**, capturing their needs, frustrations, and goals. These personas informed user stories such as:  
   - *As a student, I want to modify my housing selections so I can find a dorm that suits my needs.*  
   - *As housing staff, I want to quickly address maintenance requests so students remain satisfied.*:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

5. **Business Processes & Rules**  
   We documented core processes like housing selection, roommate matching, sanitation alerts, and repair prioritization. Business rules included timeframes for urgent vs. routine requests, required backup housing options, and inspection policies:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

6. **Use Cases & Diagrams**  
   Detailed use cases were created for housing assignment, maintenance requests, sanitation alerts, roommate matching, and inspections. Each use case included triggers, inputs, flows, invariants, and post-conditions. Context and use case diagrams helped visualize the interaction between students, staff, and parents:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.

7. **Functional Objectives & Non-Functional Requirements**  
   - **Functional:** Submit maintenance requests, select housing & waitlist options, track inspections, notify parents, support roommate matching.  
   - **Non-Functional:** Requests processed within one minute, support up to 3,000 peak users, nightly backups, two-factor authentication, and cross-platform compatibility:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.

8. **Prototypes**  
   We created interface prototypes for housing selection, maintenance requests, sanitation alerts, roommate matching, inspections, and newsletters to validate usability.

9. **Traceability & Iterations**  
   Every element in the workbook (user stories, business rules, use cases, prototypes) was traced back to team goals and stakeholder needs. We went through 20+ iterations, with each member contributing to specific sections such as scope, domain analysis, prototypes, business processes, and functional objectives:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.

## Goals and Expected Outcomes
- **Improved Housing Allocation Efficiency** – Students can view availability and waitlists in real time.  
- **Enhanced Student & Parent Satisfaction** – More control over housing and better transparency.  
- **Improved Maintenance Response** – Faster request handling and inspection-driven prevention.  
- **Measurable Outcomes:**  
  - Increase student satisfaction with housing by **25%**.  
  - Ensure all residence halls are **98% damage-free** by year’s end.  
  - Increase sanitation satisfaction by **50%**.  
  - Improve roommate satisfaction by **50%**:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}.

## Conclusion
By leveraging the SRS workbook, our team translated a real-world university housing challenge into a structured software requirements specification. The **Buckeye Living** app proposal demonstrates how requirements analysis, user-centered design, and iterative planning can be combined to produce a solution that benefits students, staff, and parents alike. This project not only provided us with practical experience in SRS documentation but also highlighted how thoughtful analysis can create meaningful improvements in student life at Ohio State.
